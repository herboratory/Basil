# Basil 🌿  
*A multi-format schema builder & converter for modern JavaScript and database tooling.*

Basil is a browser-based web app for creating, editing, and converting data schemas across multiple formats — all in one place.  
It is designed for developers who want **fast iteration**, **cross-tool consistency**, and **less friction** when working with schemas.

---

## ✨ Why Basil?

Schema definitions often get duplicated, rewritten, or drift out of sync across tools like JSON, Zod, Yup, TypeScript, and Prisma.

Basil helps you:
- Define a schema **once**
- Convert it into the formats you need
- Iterate quickly without juggling multiple tools or files

No installs. No config files. Just open the app and build.
